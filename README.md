# tinytest.extension
Example/test package extending R package tinytest

This is a very simple package, offering extra `expect` functions that can be
used with the the [tinytest](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tinytest)
package.

This package repository is aimed only to be used as a template for package
authors who wish to extend `tinytest`, and as a testing ground for tinytest
itself.
